4. number operations
Alice has invented a new card game to play with Bob. Alice made a deck of cards with random values between 1 and 52. Bob picks 5 cards. Then, he has to rearrangethe cards so that by utilizing the operations plus, minus, or times, the value of the cards reach Alice's favorite number, 42. More precisely, find operations such that `((((val1 op1 val2) op2 val3) op3 val4)op4 val5)=42`.  
Help Bob by writing a program to determine whether it is possible to reach 42 given 5 card values.  
For example, Bob picks 5 cards out of the deck containing 40, 1, 3, 4, and 20. Bob rearranges the cards and supplies four operatilons, so that 4*20-40+3-1=42.  
Input: The input consists of five integers on a line, separated by spaces. Each integer is between 1 and 52, inclusive.  
Output: Print a line containing "YES" if it is possible to reach the value 42 according to the rules of the game, or "NO" otherwise.  
Testcase 1:  
40 1 3 4 20, return YES
